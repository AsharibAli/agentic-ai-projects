1/ 
The OpenAI Agents SDK enables you to build agentic AI apps in a lightweight, easy-to-use package with very few abstractions.

Agents SDK is the official upgrade to the experimental Swarm framework

2/
The SDK is built on three simple ideas
- Agents
- Handoffs
- Guardrails

3/
What makes this SDK special? Two core principles:

1. Enough features to be useful without overwhelming you
2. Works perfectly out of the box, but can be customized when needed

4/
I‚Äôll explore each part of the SDK, starting with Agents
Agents are your AI workers üßë‚Äçüíº

5/
Running agents is super simple! The SDK handles all the complex work of:
- Starting the agent
- Letting it use tools and make decisions
- Delivering the final answer

6/
Creating an agent is super straightforward. 
You give it:
- A name
- Instructions
- A model to use
- Any tools it needs access to

7/
Running agents is where the magic happens! The SDK handles all the complex work behind the scenes

8/
The agent loop is how agents accomplish tasks that have multiple steps

9/
The SDK lets you define exactly what type of results/outputs you need:
- Simple text responses for conversational interfaces
- Structured data like JSON for programmatic use
- Rich information your app can immediately act on

10/
Want to chain multiple agents together? The SDK makes this easy
Agent SDK is perfect for building multi-agent systems.

11/
For real-time experiences, OpenAI has built in Streaming!
- Watch your agent's thinking process unfold token by token
- Get high-level updates as it makes decisions and more...

12/
Tools are how agents interact with your world. Two types:
- Hosted tools
- Function tools

13/
Handoffs might be the best feature! Create specialized agents and let them work together

14/
Handoffs are more than just routing, you can use smaller, faster models for simple tasks, and more.

15/
Context management comes in two flavors:
- Local context
- Agent context
This separation keeps things organized while giving agents just what they need to succeed.

15/
Guardrails protect your application by validating inputs before your main agent runs. 

16/
Models in the SDK are flexible! 
- Use any OpenAI model
- Mix and match different models for different agents
- Deploy fast models for simple tasks
- and more...

17/
The SDK is Python-first
- Use familiar Python patterns and libraries
- and more...

20/
Ready to build? The Agents SDK gives you production-ready AI capabilities with minimal complexity.
